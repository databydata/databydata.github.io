### 1.4 📌 One-Time Locations

### ✅ Definition  
A **one-time location** is a temporary location stored as transient master data in the system.

---

### 🚚 Purpose / Use  
Used in processes where predefined master data isn't available — such as during the creation of **forwarding orders**.  
Users can manually input address data through the UI, and the system creates a one-time location from that.

**Example:**  
A new customer requests delivery to a remote site not yet in the system → user enters address manually → system creates a one-time location.

---

### 🏗️ Structure  
A one-time location includes:
- Organization name  
- Address details  
- Communication details (e.g., phone, email)  

📝 **Note:** Only **one note** can be created per location **per language**.

---

### 🔗 Integration & Configuration  
- 🔍 To **search for addresses**:  
  Use SAP NetWeaver → Application Server → Basis Services → Address Management → *Regional Structure / City File*

- 🔁 To **match existing locations**:  
  Activate matching in:  
  `Transportation Management → Basic Functions → General Settings → Define General Settings for SAP TM`

- 🔐 **User Roles**:  
  - All standard SAP TM roles allow **read access** to one-time locations.  
  - For users creating/changing forwarding orders (e.g., **Transportation Booking Agent**), grant **create permission**.
