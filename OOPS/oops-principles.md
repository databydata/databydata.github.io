Four pillars of object-oriented programming are:
1. [Abstraction](#abstraction)
2. [Encapsulation]()
3. [Inheritance]()
4. [Polymorphism]()

### Abstraction
Abstraction refers to hide the unnecessary details and lower down the complexity.

Imagine a situation in which you want to buy a car and every time you want to start the engine you have to create sparks manually by opening the engine.   

Understanding the complete engine mechanism is necessary to create a spark at the right place and time which is unnecessary.  
 
Companies abstracted this and installed a push button to start the engine, and this is abstraction.  

This is what we try to achieve in programming.

Abstraction is done for data and process both.
