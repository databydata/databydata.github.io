Four pillars of object-oriented programming are:
1. [Abstraction](#abstraction)
2. [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)
3. [Inheritance](#inheritance)
4. [Polymorphism]()

### Abstraction
Abstraction refers to hide the unnecessary details and lower down the complexity.

Imagine a situation in which you want to buy a car and every time you want to start the engine you have to create sparks manually by opening the engine.   

Understanding the complete engine mechanism is necessary to create a spark at the right place and time which is unnecessary.  
 
Companies abstracted this and installed a push button to start the engine, and this is abstraction.  

This is what we try to achieve in programming.


### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is something in which we capsule the data memebers and provide methods for their access.

It increases security and avoids mishandling of data members(attributes).

For encapsulation we create getter and setter methods for each data members.

### Inheritance
