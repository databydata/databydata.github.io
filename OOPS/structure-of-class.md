title: Structure Of Class
---

Here we will discuss the basic structure a class which will setup the initial pace of our discussion.  

Classes in abap are created into two parts.  
First we provide a definition and then we provide an implementation.

```
    CLASS NAME DEFINITION.
        PUBLIC SECTION.
        PROTECTED SECTION.
        PRIVATE SECTION.
    ENDCLASS.

    CLASS NAME IMPLEMENTATION.

    ENDCLASS.
```

This is a structure for a class. In the following sections, we will break down each part and discuss it in detail.
